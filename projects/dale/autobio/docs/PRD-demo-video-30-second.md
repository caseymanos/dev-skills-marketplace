## 8. Boomer-Specific Considerations

### Visual Preferences
- **Larger text** - Don't assume perfect vision
- **Slower transitions** - Allow time to process
- **Clear hierarchy** - One message per screen
- **Warm colors** - Blues, warm whites, avoid neon
- **Realistic imagery** - Avoid overly polished stock photos

### Messaging That Resonates
- Family legacy and heritage
- Preserving memories for grandchildren
- "Finally" solving a long-standing problem
- Simplicity and ease of use
- Not being "tech-savvy" is OK
- Trust and security of memories

### What to Avoid
- Trendy music or effects
- Too-fast cuts or motion
- Slang or casual language
- Complicated tech terminology
- "AI" as a scary concept (frame as helpful assistant)

---

## 9. A/B Testing Plan

### Variables to Test

#### Captions
- Version A (Emotional) vs Version B (Benefit-Focused)
- Test winner vs Version C (Fear of Loss)

#### Hook (First 3 Seconds)
- Variant 1: Messy desktop (chaos visual)
- Variant 2: Question overlay "What happens to your memories?"
- Variant 3: Emotional photo of grandparent with grandchild

#### CTA
- "Start Your Memoir - Free"
- "Create Your Legacy Today"
- "Try Free - No Credit Card"
- "Tell Your Story"

### Testing Framework
1. Run each variant with $50/day budget for 3 days
2. Measure: CTR, Video watches (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
3. Kill variants with <1.5% CTR after day 2
4. Scale winner to $200/day
5. Continue iterating with new variants
